# Deep Learning Templates
This is my repo for creating the most basic neural network templates in order to learn the fundamentals of some common use cases. My main goal for this repository is to gain experience in applying:

* Convolutional neural networks (CNN)
  * Computer vision
  * NLP
* Recurrent neural networks (RNN)
  * Sequences in text, audio, video, etc.
  * Time series
* Long short term memory networks (LSTM)
  * Music generation
* Generative adversarial networks (GAN)
  * Novel art, music
  * Creating training data for other models
* More TBD...

Also, I'm aiming to gain a better understanding of:

* Keras and Tensorflow packages
* Training methods
  * backpropagation
  * gradient descent
  * stochastic gradient descent
* Activation layers
  * relu, sigmoid, tanh, etc.
* CPU vs GPU vs TPU computation
* Training in the cloud (AWS, GCP, Paperspace)
* Options for deploying neural network models
